Hi, I am a second year PhD student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). My advisor is [Prof. Jishen Zhao](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jzhao/). My primary research interest is domain-specific hardware acceleration. I received my Master Degree in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [Prof. Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/) and my bachelorâ€™s degree from Beijing Institute of Technology.

Last summer, I was interned at [Iluvatar CoreX](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iluvatar-corex-inc/), a start-up company at San Jose, while I designed and tested a Binarized Neural Network Accelerator on FPGA. I am currently doing my internship at Facebook AI Research (FAIR).

Please feel free to contact me via email.
