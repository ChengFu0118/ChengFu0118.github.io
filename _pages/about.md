Hi, I am a third year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). My advisor is [Prof. Jishen Zhao](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jzhao/). My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer architecture, and security. I received my Master Degree in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [Prof. Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/). In 2019 Summer, I did my internship at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), supervised by [Yuandong Tian](http://yuandong-tian.com/). This year, I am going to remotely intern at FAIR again, advised by [Prof. Hugh Leather](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hleather/) and Yuandong. I was also interned at [Iluvatar CoreX](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iluvatar-corex-inc/), a start-up company at San Jose, while I designed and tested a Binarized Neural Network Accelerator on FPGA. 

Please feel free to contact me via email.
